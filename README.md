# Graph Shortest Path Finder

This project demonstrates how to find the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted, directed graph using Depth-First Search (DFS). The program is implemented in C for computation and Python for visualization.

---

## Features
- Input graph structure and edges through the C program.
- Compute the shortest path between a source and destination node using DFS.
- Save results (graph structure and shortest path) into CSV files.
- Visualize the graph structure and the shortest path using Python.
- Save visualizations as PNG images.

## Requirements

### For C Program
- GCC compiler
- Standard C libraries

### For Python Visualization
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Required Python packages:
  - `pandas`
  - `networkx`
  - `matplotlib`

Install the required Python packages using:
```bash
pip install pandas networkx matplotlib
```
